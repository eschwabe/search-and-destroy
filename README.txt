INTRODUCTION
The source, executables, and media in this package were created as a part
of the University of Washington Game Development Certificates Course. The
game uses example code, models, and textures provided in the Direct3D SDK.
The game was built on the Windows platform with the Direct3D SDK installed
and Visual Studio 2008. Some additional textures were obtained from
cgtextures.com and cannot be sold.


GAME
The game provides a simple level and some models for the user to examine.
The player can either view the world through third-person view of the main
player or a debug camera that can moved anywhere.

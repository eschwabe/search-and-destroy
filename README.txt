GAME INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
The source, executables, and media in this package were created as a part of
the University of Washington Game Development Certificates Course. The game
uses example code, models, and textures provided in the Direct3D SDK. The game
was built on the Windows platform with the Direct3D SDK installed and Visual
Studio 2008. Some additional textures were obtained from cgtextures.com and
cannot be sold.


GAME
The game provides a simple grid-based level for the player to explore. Several
enemies exist in the world and will attempt to attack you. The enemies will
wander and patrol around the map trying to find the player. If the player is
in range, the enemies will start to pursue the player. The player can stun and
kill the enemies with a particle weapon. The game is over when the player
kills all the enemies or when an enemy touches the player.
